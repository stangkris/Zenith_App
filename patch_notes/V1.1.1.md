# Zenith App - Patch Notes v1.1.1.1

**Release Date:** 2026-02-17
**Focus:** Reliability, UI Refinements, Timezone Fixes, and Signal Tuning.

## 🛠️ Critical Fixes
- **Data Fetching Logic**: Removed the `end_date` restriction. The app now allows the API to return the most up-to-date data available, fixing the issue where data stopped at the 12th.
- **Timezone Display**: All charts now strictly use **Thai Time (Asia/Bangkok)**.
    - US Market Open: ~21:30 BKK.
    - No more hidden data due to incorrect US-market hour filters.

## 🎨 UI Refinements
- **Continuous Charts**: Implemented "Gapless" charts (TradingView style) by switching to a category-based X-axis. This removes large gaps during non-trading hours/weekends.
- **Maximized View**: Increased chart height to 760px to fill the screen and reduce scrolling.
- **Version Label**: Moved to the bottom of the sidebar for better aesthetics.

## ⚙️ Strategy Tuning (Signal Scarcity Fix)
Addressed the "0 Trades" issue in backtests by relaxing overly strict conditions:
- **Momentum Breakout**:
    - Consolidation Width: 6% → **15%** (Allows wider bases).
    - Volume Spike: 2.0x → **1.5x**.
- **Pullback Reversal**:
    - RSI Threshold: < 30 → **< 40** (Captures pullbacks in strong trends).
- **Volume**:
    - Spike Threshold: 2.0x → **1.5x**.

## 🧹 Code Cleanup
- **Audit**: Confirmed backtest engine has **no look-ahead bias**.
- **Optimization**: Removed unused `_calculate_backtest_metrics` function to improve code maintainability.
